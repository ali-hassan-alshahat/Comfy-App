            <p>
              FAQ pages continue to be a priority area for SEO and digital
              marketing professionals. An FAQ page is one of the simplest ways
              to improve your site and help site visitors and users. Your FAQ
              section should be seen as a constantly expanding source of value
              provided to your audience.

                1- WHY AN FAQ RESOURCE?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-0">
                Firstly, FAQ pages can bring new visitors to your website via
                organic search and drive them quickly to related pages â€“ most
                typically deeper blog pages and service pages closely related to
                the questions being resolved. Next, one of the most significant
                opportunities for impactful brand visibility within the search
                engine result pages (in-SERP) is targeting audience questions,
                wants, needs, and pain points.

                PURCHASE?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-0">
                No, there is no limit. The quantity that you can buy is
                depending on the available stock of the online purchase.

              </h2>
              <p className="mb-0">
                Most Comfy products are flat-packed, making them easy to
                transport. The Comfy store offers (or will refer you to) a home
                delivery service if you prefer. Home delivery is not included in
                the product price.

              </h2>
              <p className="mb-0">
                Every effort is made to maintain the availability of items shown
                in the catalogue, but due to popularity and supply issues, some
                products may not always be available. Generally, Comfy can
                estimate when a product should be back in stock. Because Comfy
                products are manufactured throughout the world, there are
                sometimes circumstances which can cause delivery delays

              </h2>
              <p className="mb-0">
                Comfy products are generally easy to assemble and require no
                special tools. If you prefer, most Comfy stores can refer you to
                a reputable, reasonably priced assembly company that can come to
                your home to assemble and install our products.
